1 — Short elevator pitch

A platform that lets anyone turn collections of YouTube videos into full “courses” (like Udemy) — with custom titles/description, structured sections, AI-generated practice questions and a RAG-based assistant for doubts — plus an approval & marketplace flow so creators can sell courses and learners get completion certificates.

2 — Key user flows (high level)

Creator: Paste YouTube URLs → create course metadata (title, description, price, tags) → optionally split videos into sections (manual or AI) → generate practice questions & course summary → submit for approval → once approved, publish & sell.

Learner: Browse/purchase or add free course to “My Learnings” → Open course (video player left, course outline + AI assistant + notes on right) → Mark lessons complete → Take practice tests → On course completion, receive downloadable certificate (PDF).

Owner/Admin: Review submitted course → Approve/Reject with feedback → Set revenue share and payout (Stripe/Connect).
